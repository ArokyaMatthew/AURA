🌍 AURA — Offline-First Autonomous AI Agent

AURA stands for Autonomous Universal Reasoning Agent.Intelligence should not depend on internet access.

AURA was built to solve a real and urgent problem:
millions of people are being left behind in the AI revolution simply because they don’t have reliable internet access.

This is especially true for:

Students in government and rural schools

Communities & Regions with poor or no connectivity

Users on low-end or shared computers

Environments where cloud AI is inaccessible or restricted

While most AI tools today stop working the moment the internet goes down, AURA continues to work.

🚨 The Problem

AI is rapidly becoming a core skill — in education, productivity, and employment.
But in many parts of India (and the world):

According to stats: 845 million people dont have access to Internet this is in just INDIA and that accounts to 45% of India's population.Just imagine how impactful it would be if they gets their hands on AI.

Internet access is unreliable or unavailable

Government schools often lack connectivity

Cloud-only AI tools are unusable

Students fall further behind with every technological leap

The result:
A growing gap between those who can access AI and those who cannot.

This is not a future problem.
This is happening right now.

💡 Our Solution: AURA

AURA is an offline-first autonomous AI agent that:

Works without internet

Runs entirely on the local machine

Automates real tasks, not just conversations

Seamlessly switches to online mode when internet is available

AURA brings practical AI assistance to places where cloud AI cannot reach.

⚙️ What AURA Can Do
📴 Offline (No Internet Required)

Understand natural language commands

Automate desktop tasks (open apps, write files, run commands)

Assist with writing, learning, and problem-solving

Remember user preferences and past interactions

Run fully on CPU-only systems (no GPU needed)

📡 Online (When Internet Is Available)

Use cloud AI for enhanced reasoning

Access latest information

Combine local reliability with cloud power

One system. Two modes. Always available.

🧠 How It Works (High Level)

Offline mode:
Uses a local language model running entirely on the user’s machine.
No data leaves the device.

Online mode:
Automatically switches to cloud intelligence for more advanced capabilities.

This hybrid design ensures:

Reliability in low-connectivity environments

Privacy-first operation

Future scalability

🎯 Who This Is For

Students in government & rural schools

Teachers and educators

Low-connectivity regions

Privacy-conscious users

Anyone who believes AI should be accessible to all

🤝 An Open Invitation

If you are:

Passionate about education

Concerned about the digital divide

Interested in building offline-first AI

Willing to help bring technology to people without internet access

You can be a government school teacher or a curious mind who can work on this to make it big.

I would genuinely love to collaborate.

This project is not just code — it’s built with an intent.
If needed, I am personally happy to work towards taking AURA to the people who need it most.

🏁 Hackathon Note

AURA was built during the Google TechSprint 24-Hour Hackathon
as a focused effort to demonstrate that:

AI can be inclusive, resilient, and human-centric — not just cloud-dependent.

🌱 Vision

This is only the beginning.

The long-term vision for AURA is:

A personal AI that works anywhere

Learns from the user locally

Respects privacy by default

Bridges the gap between technology and accessibility

The future of AI should not belong only to those with fast internet.
It should belong to everyone.

Anyone who feel that they can make this Big and contribute in taking this to everyone and you already have 100 to 200 ready users then you can happily use this project and even contact me to develop this project more further
,For now post Hackathon we are not working more on this but will show Interest If anyone comes with right capabilty.

How to use:

to start frontend:
cd ....AURA/frontend
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
npm run start

to start backend:
cd ...../AURA
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload

install requirements in requirements.txt 
Should be run in 2 seperate terminals for performance.

Together, we can make sure no one is left behind in the AI era.
